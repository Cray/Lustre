	List of maintainers and how to submit Lustre changes

Please try to follow the guidelines below.  This will make things
easier on the maintainers.  Not all of these guidelines matter for every
trivial patch so apply some common sense.

1.	Always _test_ your changes, however small.

2.	PLEASE remember that submissions must be made under the terms
	of the Linux Foundation certificate of contribution and should
	include a Signed-off-by: line.  The current version of this
	"Developer's Certificate of Origin" (DCO) is listed in the file
	Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst.

3.	Make sure your changes compile correctly in multiple
	configurations. In particular check that changes work both as a
	module and built into the kernel.

4.	Add reviewers to the patch based on the get_maintainers.pl script.

5.	PLEASE check your patch with the automated style checker
	(contrib/scripts/checkpatch.pl) to catch trivial style violations.

6.	Make sure you have the right to send any changes you make. If you
	do changes at work you may find your employer owns the patch
	not you.

7.	Happy hacking.

Descriptions of section entries:

	M: Mail patches to: FullName <address@domain>
	R: Designated reviewer: FullName <address@domain>
	   These reviewers should be CCed on patches.
	W: Web-page with status/info
	B: URI for where to file bugs. A web-page with detailed bug
	   filing info, a direct bug tracker link, or a mailto: URI.
	C: URI for chat protocol, server and channel where developers
	   usually hang out, for example irc://server/channel.
	T: SCM tree type and location.
	   Type is one of: git, hg, quilt, stgit, topgit
	S: Status, one of the following:
	   Supported:	Someone is actually paid to look after this.
	   Maintained:	Someone actually looks after it.
	   Odd Fixes:	It has a maintainer but they don't have time to do
			much other than throw the odd patch in. See below..
	   Orphan:	No current maintainer [but maybe you could take the
			role as you write your new code].
	   Obsolete:	Old code. Something tagged obsolete generally means
			it has been replaced by a better system and you
			should be using that.
	F: Files and directories with wildcard patterns.
	   A trailing slash includes all files and subdirectory files.
	   F:	drivers/net/	all files in and below drivers/net
	   F:	drivers/net/*	all files in drivers/net, but not below
	   F:	*/net/*		all files in "any top level directory"/net
	   One pattern per line.  Multiple F: lines acceptable.
	N: Files and directories with regex patterns.
	   N:	[^a-z]tegra	all files whose path contains the word tegra
	   One pattern per line.  Multiple N: lines acceptable.
	   scripts/get_maintainer.pl has different behavior for files that
	   match F: pattern and matches of N: patterns.  By default,
	   get_maintainer will not look at git log history when an F: pattern
	   match occurs.  When an N: match occurs, git log history is used
	   to also notify the people that have git commit signatures.
	X: Files and directories that are NOT maintained, same rules as F:
	   Files exclusions are tested before file matches.
	   Can be useful for excluding a specific subdirectory, for instance:
	   F:	net/
	   X:	net/ipv6/
	   matches all files in and below net excluding net/ipv6/
	K: Keyword perl extended regex pattern to match content in a
	   patch or file.  For instance:
	   K: of_get_profile
	      matches patches or files that contain "of_get_profile"
	   K: \b(printk|pr_(info|err))\b
	      matches patches or files that contain one or more of the words
	      printk, pr_info or pr_err
	   One regex pattern per line.  Multiple K: lines acceptable.

This list is meant to remain in alphabetical order. Please add yourselves
to it in alphabetical order.  Please include "Lustre" in the subsystem
description, even though it is currently redundant, so that it is easier
to keep this in sync once the client is merged upstream.
