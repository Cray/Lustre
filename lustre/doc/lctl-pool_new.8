.TH LCTL-POOL_NEW 8 2024-08-14 Lustre "Lustre Configuration Utilities"
.SH NAME
lctl-pool_new \- create a new OST pool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SY "lctl pool_new"
.RB [ --nowait | -n ]
.IR FSNAME . POOL
.YS
.SH DESCRIPTION
Create a list of OSTs with the name
.I POOLNAME
in the filesystem named
.IR FSNAME .
The
.B lctl pool_new
command must be run on the MGS node and can only be used by the
root user.
.P
.BR NOTE:
After updating the MGS configuration, this command tries to wait and
check if pools are updated on a client.
If the MGS is on a separate node from the MDS, a Lustre client must
be mounted on the MGS node while the
.B lctl
commands are being run for this. Otherwise, the client check is
skipped.
.P
This named list of OSTs can be used by
.BR lfs-setstripe (1)
to specify the OSTs on which new files can be created, and
.BR lfs-find (1)
to locate files that were created on the specified pool. As well,
.BR lfs-df (1)
can show only the free space or inodes in a named pool.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR -n ", " --nowait
Do not wait and check if pool is updated on a client. This is useful
when calling a lot of "
.B lctl
pool_*" in a row. This avoids revoking the clients "CONFIG" lock for each
command (by default clients retake their lock and update their configurations
in a delay between 5-10s).
