# This is the per-client lustre configuration file.
# The parameters declared in this file will be set after the system has mounted,
# but only on this node.

# if mount.$FS_NAME.params exists, the parameters declared in
# that file will be loaded afterwards, meaning the filesystem
# specific parameters will override the client specific ones.

# Examples:
# max_dirty_mb=7873
# mdc.*.max_rpcs_in_flight=16
# jobid_var=nodelocal
# jobid_name=%H:%e:%u
